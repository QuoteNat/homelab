This repo consists of two components:
1. An ansible playbook that updates my home server containing a few self hosted docker services.
2. A docker-compose file that run a handful of lightweight services.

A few notes about the current config:
This server is accessed through a tailscale meshnet. Currently everything runs on a Raspberry Pi 3b+ with about 1 GB of RAM and 4 threads.
